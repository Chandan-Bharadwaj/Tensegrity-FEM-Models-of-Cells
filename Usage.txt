This repository contans three main programs
Main_code_1_tensegrities.m ,
Main_code_2_cell_models.m and
Main_code_3_Form_Finding.m

- These serve the purpose of using standard tensegrity structures and generate cell models out of them
- a new stable tensegrity structure can be created using the numerical form finding technique

Generate Cell models

1)  Open 'Main_code_1_tensegrities.m' or 'Main_code_2_cell_models.m'
2) In the Model Generation section,  select tensegrity structure or cell model to be generated and run the code
  -  The corresponding tensegrity structure or cell model will be displayed along with the mode shapes( from eigenvalue analysis)
  -  Corresponding APDL Macro codes will be printed onto the console 
3) Copy and paste the APDL codes onto a macro script which will help generate a line model of the cell in Ansys Mechanical APDL.

Form Finding of a new tensegrity

1) Open "Main_code_3_Form_Finding.m" 
2) the code can be used to execute either of the following cases:
 - generate a standard tensegrity -> randomize its nodes -> get back the original form through form-finding (using elements data)
 - Make a new tensegrity structure - make a new elements connections data and obtain a stable form of the new tensegrity

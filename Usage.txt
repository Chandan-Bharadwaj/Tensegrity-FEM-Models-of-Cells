This repository contans three main programs
Main_code_1_tensegrities.m
Main_code_2_cell_models.m
Main_code_1_tensegrities.m


Generate Cell models

1)  Open 'Main_code_1_tensegrities.m' or 'Main_code_2_cell_models.m'
2) In the Model Generation section,  select tensegrity structure or cell model to be genereted 
- The correspoinding tensegrity structure or cell model will be displayred along with the mode shapes( from eigen value analysis)
- Corresponding APDL Macro codes will be printed onto the console 
3) Copy and paste the APDL codes onto a macro script which will help  generate a line model of the cell in Ansys Mechanical APDL.

Form Finding of a new tensegrity

1) Open "Main_code_3_Form_Finding.m"
2) generate a standard tensegrity -> randomize its nodes -> get back the original form through form finding (using elements data)
3) Make a new tensegrity structure - make your own elements connections
       and obtain a stable form of the new tensegrity

Different Activities that can be done
-------------
- a tool to generate tensegrities
	- prismatic, spherical (6, 12 , 30, others) , planar
- generate our own tensegrity and form find the nearest match
- generate tensegrity cell models
	- change dimensions, nucleus positions, etc
- a collection of cells to create an environment
